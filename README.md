# phylogenetic-tree

My final year project for masters at University of Nottingham.

A phylogenetic tree is a hierarchical graph used to represent evolutionary relationships between organisms. Think tree of life / ancestry of organisms. The project aimed to innovate phylogenetic tree visualisation's by using a number of different techniques. Most notably the use of 3D, VR, sphere coordinates, and hyperbolic space.

The project in its current state is in two halfs, a backend C# program that convest file types, and a front end displayer.
Originally I had planned to host the C# program and allow the entire project to be accessed webend. But it was not practical
in the timeframe.
